;;; This should not be particularly difficult, and you could probably get it done this week if you wished.
;;; A Q-learner that learns to play Nim.
;;; 
;;; This project is an easy assignment.
;;; What I'm asking you to do is to complete the assignment, then
;;; "enhance" it in some way.  
;;;
;;; - Try prioritized sweeping (ask me)
;;; - Try comparing approaches to alpha, gamma, action-selection procedures, ways of implementing the "opponent, etc.  
;;; - Try extending to 3-Heap Nim (again, ask me).
;;; Something fun.
;;; 
;;; You might also try to analyze what happens when you try random opponents versus co-adaptive ones.  Advantages?  Disadvantages?
;;; 
;;; ABOUT NIM
;;; ---------
;;; There are several versions of Nim.  The version we will play is called 1-Heap Nim
;;; and it goes like this:
;;; 
;;; 1. Put N sticks in a pile (called a "heap")
;;; 2. Players take turns taking 1, 2, or 3 sticks out of the heap.
;;; 3. Whoever has to take out the last stick loses.
;;; 
;;; 
;;; LEARNING NIM
;;; ------------
;;; 
;;; Our Q-learner will build a Q-table solely through playing itself over and over
;;; again.  The table will tell it, ultimately, how smart it is to do a given move
;;; (take 1, 2, or 3 sticks) in a given state (number of sticks taken out so far).
;;; Q values will all start at 0.
;;; 
;;; We will define the actions as follows:
;;; 
;;; Action 0: take 1 stick out
;;; Action 1: take 2 sticks out
;;; Action 2: take 3 sticks out
;;; 
;;; Thus the action number is exactly 1- the number of sticks to take out.  Keep
;;; this in mind -- the Q table will store Q values by action number, NOT by
;;; sticks taken out.
;;; 
;;; We will define the states as follows:
;;; 
;;; State 0: no sticks removed from heap
;;; State 1: 1 stick removed from heap
;;; ...
;;; State N: N sticks removed from heap
;;; 
;;; You will probably find it useful for the number of states in the Q table to
;;; be, believe it or not, about 6 larger than the heap size.  Thus there are
;;; some states at the high end of the table which represent, more or less,
;;; "negative heap sizes".  Of course, you can never play a negative heap size;;; 
;;; such q-values will stay 0.
;;; 
;;; Our Q table will be a STATE x ACTION array.  I have given you some functions
;;; which should make it easy to use this array:  NUM-STATES, NUM-ACTIONS,
;;; MAKE-Q-TABLE, MAX-Q, and MAX-ACTION.
;;; 
;;; The Q learner will learn by playing itself: the learner records the current
;;; state, makes a move, lets the ``opponent'' make a move, then notes the new
;;; resulting state.  The action is the move the learner made.  Now we have s,
;;; a, and s'.  Note that s' is the state AFTER the opponent made his move.
;;; 
;;; After the Q learner has learned the game, then you can play the learner
;;; and see how well it does.
;;; 
;;; 
;;; WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
;;; -------------------
;;; 
;;; Your job is to implement several functions:
;;; 
;;; Q-LEARNER
;;;   (the Q update function)
;;; LEARN-NIM
;;;   (the learning algorithm, tweaked for Nim -- the longest function)
;;; PLAY-NIM
;;;   (lets you play against the learned Q table)
;;; BEST-ACTIONS
;;;   (returns a list of the best actions believed so far)
;;; 
;;; To help you, I've written a basic ALPHA function, and MAKE-USER-MOVE
;;; and ASK-IF-USER-GOES-FIRST functions.  I predict you will find them helpful.
;;; 
;;; 
;;;  Mail me this file, modified as you like but nicely and cleanly.
;;;  It should run without issue on SBCL ideally.  Try to eliminate
;;;  all compilation warnings, and have NO GLOBAL VARIABLE WARNINGS.
;;; 
;;; 
;;; THE SECRET OF NIM (ugh, that was bad)
;;; -----------------
;;; 
;;; You can get an idea for how well these settings perform by seeing what's
;;; usually the smallest number of iterations necessary before BEST-ACTIONS starts
;;; reporting the correct actions.
;;; 
;;; So what ARE the correct actions in Nim?  There is a very simple rule for playing
;;; Nim.  If there are N sticks left in the pile, you want to remove sticks so that
;;; N = 1 + 4A where A is some number.  Then whatever your opponent takes out, you take
;;; 4 minus that number, so your sticks and your opponent's sticks removed sum to 4.
;;; Keep on doing this, and eventually the A's will get dropped and your opponent will
;;; be left with 1 stick, which he must take.
;;; 
;;; Depending on the size of the Nim heap, the game is either a guaranteed win for
;;; the first player or for the second player.  It all depends on who can get it down
;;; to 1 + 4A first.
;;; 
;;; You will discover a certain pattern emerge in your BEST-ACTIONS list.  The first
;;; couple of values may be odd, but then from there on out you'll see
;;; 2, 1, 0, <any>, 2, 1, 0, <any>, etc.  This is because in each of those heap
;;; values, the right move is to remove 3, 2, or 1 sticks, or (in the <any> value)
;;; it doesn't matter because you're guaranteed to lose at that heap size.  In essence
;;; you want to get your OPPONENT down to the <any> value (it's the 1 + 4A number).
;;; 
;;; 
;;; VERY STRONG HINT
;;; 
;;; Keep in mind how the Q table is structured: actions are stored in the slot
;;; 1 less than the number of sticks removed by that action.  And states go UP
;;; as more sticks are removed.   You may need to do some 1-'s and 1+'s to play
;;; the right action.
;;; 
;;; 
;;; INTERESTING TRIVIA
;;; 
;;; Nim's been done a lot.  I was going to do tic-tac-toe, but decided it was too
;;; evil.  :-)
